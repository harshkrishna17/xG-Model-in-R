# xG-Model-in-R
A simple xG model in R using coordinate data.

Data from Understat (Opta event data). Variables used to determine xG are the distance to the centre of the goal, angle to the centre of the goal, and whether the shot was a header or not.

Data compiled thanks to [Nandy](https://github.com/nandy47).
